# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website built with Vite, React, and styled using Tailwind CSS. Follow the steps below to set up the project on your local system.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/inteshar/mrxiwlev.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd mrxiwlev
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Use npm (or yarn) to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Rename the `.envexample` file to `.env`:

   Update the `.env` file with your environment variables as needed.

## Running the Project

Your portfolio website will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
